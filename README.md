# Caesar Cipher Decoder

A program that encrypts a message using one of the oldest known encryption techniques, called Caesar cipher, attributed to Julius Caesar. It involves replacing each letter in a message with another letter that is a fixed number of positions later in the alphabet (shift). If the replacement would go past the letter Z, the cipher “wraps around” to the beginning of the alphabet.
